## Reporting a Vulnerability

As a security tool designed for Bug Bounty Hunters, we take security vulnerabilities within the extension itself extremely seriously. 

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them privately by reaching out directly to the maintainer via Direct Message on X/Twitter at [x.com/sagarbanwa](https://x.com/sagarbanwa).

Please include the following in your report:
* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* The exact browser and version of the extension you are using.
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue (a Proof of Concept).
* The potential impact regarding data leaks or execution.

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and aim to patch verified vulnerabilities promptly.
